# Moving to paradise:
Since mid 20th century there has been a migration of the Spanish population, from the interior to the main cities, such as Madrid or Barcelona.  
Since the apparition of Covid-19 the concept of office has been redefined. Everyday working from the home office is more and more common. That has pushed the interest of people to leave the big cities and move seeking better prices, tranquility and peace in smaller villages, which at the same time are looking forward to welcome new inhabitants.
