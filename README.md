# Moving to paradise:
Since mid 20th century there has been a migration of the Spanish population, from the interior to the main cities, such as Madrid or Barcelona.  
Since Covid-19 the concept of office has been redefined. Everyday, working from home is more and more common. That has pushed the interest of people to leave the big cities and move. Seeking better prices, tranquility and peace in smaller villages, which at the same time are looking forward to welcome new inhabitants.

With this premise I have created some tools to gather data from villages in some depopulated areas in spain in order to help people decide where is it best for them to leave. This database has been created in Mongo DB, so it is a Non relational database.
